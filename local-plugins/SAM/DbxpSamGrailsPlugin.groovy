    def description = '''\
SAM is an open source application for storing numerical phenotype observations related to biological studies, within the framework of the Phenotype Database.
Background: The Phenotype Database (dbXP, see http://dbnp.org) project is an open source ecosystem for multi-omics databases.
One of the modules of the Phenotype Database (dbXP) is the Simple assay module (SAM), in which it is easy to import bulk numerical data from e.g. Excel files.
It can be used to store clinical data, such as Rules Based Medicine assays, but also physical measurements such as body weight of mice.
