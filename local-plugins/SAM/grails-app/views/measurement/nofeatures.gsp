        <h1>Before we can start importing measurements, we need features</h1>

        <p>At this moment the measurement importer can not be used. The reason for this is that no features are known at this moment. Please import the features you want using the 
        <g:link controller="SAMImporter" action="upload" params="${[importer: "Features", module: module]}">feature importer</g:link>
         or <g:link class="create" controller="feature" action="create" params="${[module: module]}">create the features by hand</g:link>. As soon as features are present the measurement importer will become usable.</p>
